# CodeLensAI
CodeLens AI combines the precision of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis with the contextual understanding of artificial intelligence to provide deep insights into your codebase. By leveraging a hybrid graph + vector database architecture, it can:

Detect relationships between code elements that traditional static analysis would miss
Understand semantic meaning of functions and classes across multiple languages
Find ideal locations for implementing new features or fixes
Identify patterns and code smells that might impact maintainability
Provide context-aware explanations of how your code works

Perfect for large codebases, complex applications, and teams looking to improve code quality and understanding.
